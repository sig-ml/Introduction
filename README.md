# Introduction
Introductory reading for people who are new to Sig-ML

> "All models are wrong. Some are useful" -George Box

## What is this?  

Github is an online collaboration platform based on the Git version control system ([1]). It let's us share our code with the rest of the world painlessly. Moreover, it lets members of Sigml work on common interests even after they have moved on from the institute.

## Repositories?  

All programs that we develop are stored here as different repositories. Some repositories grow big enough to have their own team and you can ask to be included in them.

## Teams?  

There are two general teams. **Born early** and **Born late**. This is essentially second years and first years. Besides that different teams crop up as per repositories and projects.
